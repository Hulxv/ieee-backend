**Superglobals in PHP**

Superglobals are predefined variables in PHP that are accessible throughout your entire script, regardless of the scope (functions, blocks, etc.). They provide a convenient way to access information from various sources:

- `$_GET`: Contains key-value pairs extracted from the URL query string (data appended after the `?` symbol). Often used for retrieving data (e.g., searching, filtering).
- `$_POST`: Contains key-value pairs submitted through HTML form POST requests. Typically used for submitting data for processing (e.g., form submissions, updates, deletions).
- `$_REQUEST`: Combines information from both `$_GET` and `$_POST`. Use with caution as it might lead to unexpected behavior depending on the context.
- `$_SERVER`: Holds information about the web server and environment variables (e.g., server name, HTTP headers, request method).
- `$_COOKIE`: Stores data retrieved from cookies sent by the browser (e.g., user preferences, session ID).
- `$_SESSION` (session must be started): Used for session data that persists across multiple requests (e.g., shopping cart contents, user login status).
- `$_FILES`: Contains information about uploaded files through HTML forms.

**GET vs. POST Methods in PHP**

Both GET and POST are HTTP methods used to send data from an HTML form to a PHP script. However, they differ in how they handle data:

**GET:**

- Appends form data to the URL query string (visible in the address bar).
- Limited data size (around 2048 characters) due to URL length restrictions.
- **Not secure** for sensitive data as it's exposed in the URL.
- Often used to **retrieve data** (e.g., searching, filtering).
- Requests are cached by the browser and can be bookmarked.

**POST:**

- Sends data in the HTTP request body, **not visible** in the URL.
- No practical data size limit.
- **More secure** for sensitive data as it's not exposed in the URL.
- Often used to **submit data** for processing (e.g., form submissions, updates, deletions).
- Requests are not cached and cannot be bookmarked.

**Closures in PHP**

Closures are anonymous functions that can access variables from their enclosing scope (where they were defined) even after the function has returned. This allows closures to "remember" the environment they were created in, making them useful for:

- Creating event handlers that need access to data from the surrounding code.
- Implementing private methods within a class-like functionality without defining a full class.
- Simulating object-oriented programming features in a more functional style.

**Creating a Database with PostgreSQL and PHP**

Here are the steps to create a new database using PostgreSQL and PHP (assuming the PostgreSQL extension is installed):

1. **Connect:**

   ```php
   $db = pg_connect("host=your_host dbname=your_db user=your_user password=your_password");
   if (!$db) {
       echo "Error: Could not connect to database";
       exit;
   }
   ```

2. **Create Database:**

   ```php
   $sql = "CREATE DATABASE my_new_database";
   $result = pg_query($db, $sql);
   if (pg_last_error($db)) {
       echo "Error creating database: " . pg_last_error($db);
       exit;
   }
   echo "Database 'my_new_database' created successfully";
   ```

3. **Close Connection:**

   ```php
   pg_close($db);
   ```

Remember to replace placeholders (`your_host`, `your_db`, `your_user`, `your_password`) with your actual credentials.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small text files stored on the user's browser that contain information about the user and their activity on a website. They are often used to:

- Remember user preferences (e.g., language, login state).
- Track user behavior (e.g., pages visited, items added to cart).
- Personalize the user experience (e.g., recommending products based on past purchases).

**Creating Cookies in PHP**

You can create cookies using the `setcookie` function:

```php
setcookie("username", "mohamed", time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // Expires in 30 days, accessible on all paths
```

This code creates a cookie named "username" with the value "mohamed", that expires


**include() vs. require()**

Both `include` and `require` are used to include the contents of another PHP file into the current script. However, they differ in how they handle errors:

- `include`:
    - If the file is not found, it generates a warning (E_WARNING) but the script continues execution.
    - Useful for including optional files that are not essential for the script's functionality.

- `require`:
    - If the file is not found, it generates a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and halts the script's execution.
    - Use `require` for essential files that are critical for the script to function properly.
